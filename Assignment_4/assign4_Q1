Question 1
By how many ways we can access elements in the DOM and write about them in brief?

Ans:
1.  By ID
 Every single element in the DOM has a unique ID and 
 we can access this element by ID with the getElementById() method of the document object.

 2. By ClassName
 The class attribute is used to access one or more specific elements in the DOM. 
 We can get all the elements with a given class name with the getElementsByClassName() method.

 3.By TagName
 A less specific way to access multiple elements on the page would be by its HTML tag name.
We access an element by tag with the getElementsByTagName() method.

4.Query Selectors
The querySelector() method returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector in the document. 
It only returns the first element that matches the specified selectors. 
To return all the matches, we use the querySelectorAll() method .
